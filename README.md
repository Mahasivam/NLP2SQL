# NLP2SQL: Natural Language to SQL Query Generator

NLP2SQL is an advanced Python-based application that leverages deep learning to convert natural language questions into structured SQL queries. Designed to bridge the gap between non-technical users and relational databases, NLP2SQL enables intuitive data retrieval through conversational interfaces powered by state-of-the-art NLP models, Langchain, Flask, and Ollama.

## üöÄ Features

- **Natural Language Processing (NLP):** Utilizes cutting-edge NLP models to comprehend and process user queries.
- **SQL Generation:** Transforms parsed natural language queries into executable SQL statements compatible with various relational databases.
- **Reinforcement Learning:** Implements reinforcement learning techniques to continually improve query generation accuracy and efficiency.
- **Schema Awareness:** Integrates database schema information to ensure contextually relevant and syntactically correct SQL queries.
- **Extensibility:** Modular architecture allows easy integration and customization for different database systems.

## üß± Architecture Overview

NLP2SQL consists of several key components:

1. **Input Processing:** Captures and preprocesses user input to extract meaningful entities and intents.
2. **Query Parsing:** Applies NLP techniques to identify the underlying query structure.
3. **SQL Generation:** Converts the parsed query into SQL statements using templates and learned patterns.
4. **Execution Engine:** Executes generated SQL queries against the target database and retrieves results.
5. **Feedback Loop:** Uses reinforcement learning to refine query generation based on execution outcomes.

## üîß Installation

Follow these steps to set up NLP2SQL on your machine:

### **Prerequisites**

- **Python 3.8+**
- **Ollama:** [Official installation guide](https://ollama.com/download) (make sure Ollama is installed and running)

### **Steps**

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Mahasivam/NLP2SQL.git
    cd NLP2SQL
    ```

2. **Create a virtual environment:**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    ```

3. **Activate the virtual environment:**

    - **macOS / Linux:**
        ```bash
        source venv/bin/activate
        ```

    - **Windows:**
        ```bash
        venv\Scripts\activate
        ```

4. **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install Flask langchain ollama
    ```

## ‚ö°Ô∏è Quick Start

Once you've installed all requirements and activated your virtual environment, you can start the application:

```bash
python app.py
```

_Note: Replace `app.py` with the main entry point of your application if different._

---

## üìù Usage

- Interact with the application via its web interface or API endpoint.
- Enter your natural language query (e.g., "Show me all employees hired after 2020").
- NLP2SQL will process the input, generate the corresponding SQL query, execute it, and return the results.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Customization & Extensibility

- **Database Support:** Easily extend support for different database systems by modifying the execution engine.
- **Model Integration:** Swap or fine-tune NLP models for better accuracy or performance.
- **Feedback & Learning:** Enhance reinforcement learning mechanisms for improved query transformations.
