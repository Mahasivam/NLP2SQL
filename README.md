NLP2SQL: Natural Language to SQL Query Generator (Python + Langchain + Flask + Ollama)
NLP2SQL is an advanced Python-based application that leverages deep learning to convert natural language questions into structured SQL queries. This project is designed to bridge the gap between non-technical users and relational databases, enabling intuitive data retrieval through conversational interfaces.

ðŸš€ Features
Natural Language Processing (NLP): Utilizes state-of-the-art NLP models to understand and process user queries.

SQL Generation: Transforms parsed queries into executable SQL statements compatible with various relational databases.

Reinforcement Learning: Implements reinforcement learning techniques to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of query generation.

Schema Awareness: Incorporates database schema information to ensure generated queries are contextually relevant and syntactically correct.

Extensibility: Designed with modular components to facilitate easy integration and customization for different database systems.

ðŸ§± Architecture
The system architecture comprises several key components:

Input Processing: Captures and preprocesses user input to extract meaningful entities and intents.

Query Parsing: Applies NLP techniques to parse the input and identify the underlying query structure.

SQL Generation: Converts the parsed query into an SQL statement using predefined templates and learned patterns.

Execution Engine: Executes the generated SQL query against the target database and retrieves the results.

Feedback Loop: Employs reinforcement learning to refine the query generation process based on execution outcomes.

ðŸ”§ Installation
To get started with NLP2SQL, you'll need to install the required dependencies. You can do this by creating a virtual environment and installing the packages listed below.

Prerequisites
Python 3.8+

Ollama: Make sure you have Ollama installed and running. Follow the official Ollama installation guide for your operating system.

Steps
1. Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/Mahasivam/NLP2SQL.git
cd NLP2SQL

2. Create a virtual environment:

python -m venv venv
Activate the virtual environment:

On macOS and Linux:

source venv/bin/activate

On Windows:

venv\Scripts\activate

3. Install the requirements:

pip install Flask langchain ollama
After following these steps, your environment will be set up with all the necessary packages to run the application.
