NLP2SQL: Natural Language to SQL Query Generator (Python + Langchain + Flask + Ollama)
NLP2SQL is an advanced Python-based application that leverages deep learning to convert natural language questions into structured SQL queries. This project is designed to bridge the gap between non-technical users and relational databases, enabling intuitive data retrieval through conversational interfaces.

ðŸš€ Features
Natural Language Processing (NLP): Utilizes state-of-the-art NLP models to understand and process user queries.

SQL Generation: Transforms parsed queries into executable SQL statements compatible with various relational databases.

Reinforcement Learning: Implements reinforcement learning techniques to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of query generation.

Schema Awareness: Incorporates database schema information to ensure generated queries are contextually relevant and syntactically correct.

Extensibility: Designed with modular components to facilitate easy integration and customization for different database systems.

ðŸ§± Architecture
The system architecture comprises several key components:

Input Processing: Captures and preprocesses user input to extract meaningful entities and intents.

Query Parsing: Applies NLP techniques to parse the input and identify the underlying query structure.

SQL Generation: Converts the parsed query into an SQL statement using predefined templates and learned patterns.

Execution Engine: Executes the generated SQL query against the target database and retrieves the results.

Feedback Loop: Employs reinforcement learning to refine the query generation process based on execution outcomes.
